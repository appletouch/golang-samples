# GAB Session Downloader

This sample downloads data about sessions (Markdown format) from [Global Azure Bootcamp Austria 2019](https://coding-club-linz.github.io/global-azure-bootcamp-2019/) website (GitHub) and stores it in JSON files. Based on that, it offers some basic RESTful web APIs to query the session data.

You can use this sample as a sample API for e.g. Angular apps. Additionally, it demonstrates the following aspects of Go:

* Perform HTTP requests
* Read YAML (front matter in markdown files)
* Turn markdown into HTML
* Implement a simple web API
